On a very hot summer day in the fields, a thirsty crow flew everywhere in search of water. Suddenly, his gaze landed on a pitcher on the ground with little water in it. The water level was too low, and the pitcher had a narrow neck, because of which the crow could not drink the water.Then an idea came to him. He started picking the pebbles scattered near the pitcher and dropping them into it one by one. As pebbles went into the pitcher, the water rose. The crow drank the water and thanked mother nature.
